            Is the idea of New York City as a sanctuary city still true for refugees? I wanted to
            ask people if they thought this was still true today by creating a guessing game for
            people to complete a line graph. Information and data provided by the US State
            Departmentâ€™s Refugee Processing Center which is revealed by AR. This project was
            conducted at the Parsons School Of Design as part of a Data Visualization exhibition.
