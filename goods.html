            <div class="caption">The project started out with two ideas of reselling clothing and creating a service for social impact. I wanted to see if I could merge these two worlds together. I started my research by talking to various people who have sold clothing on the internet. I also did field observations by going to various reselling clothing stores and fashion events in New York City. </div>
