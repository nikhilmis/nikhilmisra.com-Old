                            Research<br /><br />The project started out with two
                            ideas of reselling clothing and creating a service
                            for social impact. I wanted to see if I could merge
                            these two worlds together. I started my research by
                            talking to various people who have sold clothing on
                            the internet. I also did field observations by going
                            to various reselling clothing stores and fashion
                            events in New York City.

                        After conducting research, I went through a couple
                        rounds of wireframing and prototyping. Throughout each
                        step of the process, changes were constantly made to the
                        product.
