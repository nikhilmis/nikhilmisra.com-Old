                    Perspective is an editorial app that focuses on social
                    impact issues which pulls articles from various sources and
                    is also focused on user submitted content. The app was
                    inspired by the lack of transparency and trust in media.

                            news app based on my discussions with people on the
                            lack of engagement and transparency in media.
