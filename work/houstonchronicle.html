        The Houston Chronicle is the largest newspaper in Texas and fourth
        largest in the United States. At Hearst Newspapers, I have been
        responsible for the redesign of the Houston Chronicle website and
        defining the Chronicle's digital presence. You can view the site
        <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com">here</a>

            <p>Research</p>
            <p>The project started out with two ideas of
            reselling clothing and creating a service for social impact. I
            wanted to see if I could merge these two worlds together. I started
            my research by talking to various people who have sold clothing on
            the internet. I also did field observations by going to various
            reselling clothing stores and fashion events in New York City.</p>

        <div class="caption2">
          After conducting research, I went through a couple rounds of
          wireframing and prototyping. Throughout each step of the process,
          changes were constantly made to the product.

          The selling feature was designed to be simple to use. Any type of user
          can sell on Goods., from a streetwear reselling veteran to someone
          selling something for the very first time.

          The highlight feature of Goods. is the ability to donate a portion of
          the purchase to one of our organization partners. The user can read
          more information on our current partners and are able to select where
          there donation goes to upon checkout.
